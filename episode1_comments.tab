I fell sadness.<br />It‚Äôs said on the documentary that the Neanderthals weren‚Äôt ‚Äúhumans‚Äù and therefore, were animals. According to this reasoning, one asks itself, what will the future egoic human species in thousands of years from now call our ‚Äúmodern‚Äù species (if we are still here)..

These people are fully developed modern humans just like us.&quot;<br />Wrong BBC.<br />Yes, the people of 70,0000 years ago and modern blacks are the same.<br />But the last 50,000 years was one of the most rapid periods of evolution for our species.<br />Those that traveled north and adapted to the new conditions evolved rapidly.<br />The difference is huge compared to those that remained in Africa during that period and remained much the same during the last 50,000 years. Blacks are living fossils of that time.<br />DNA sequencing even shows thatr the HSs that left Africa later obtained neanderthal DNA from interbredding. Something that is absent in blacks.<br />Evidence is here in living people. In fact, the two groups can be classified as different species.¬†<br />Blacks and non blacks.

More likely they discovered what seeds do when grains started growing in their refuse piles and someone got curious and pulled one out finding it growing from a seed like any sprout. At that point became the experiment the next harvest time. Or it could have been simple deduction, being hunter gatherers on the move all the time they would be transporting grain from where they collected it to an area it isn&#39;t at. The next time they camped at the same camp the grain was growing around where it was ground into flour. Then they though to sacrifice some of the grain they recently collected and thus farming discovered and in a hundred years or so they stopped the constant on the move when the farms could produce enough food for a year. Probably was a slow decline in migrating, from weeks at the same camp, to a month, to a few months, half a year, until they stayed in spot year around.

The 70,000-years old Homo Sapiens woman who was an ancestor of non-sub-Saharan Africans could not have &quot;united us ALL&quot;, as the narrator pompously says: precisely, she was NOT an ancestor to sub-Saharan Africans! When will it be time to understand that even if H. Sapiens would have never left Africa (say, Europe and Asia would only be full of yummy fruits and animals; America would be barren, uninhabited and forgotten), humankind would exist anyway?? Also, the depiction of H. S. Neanderthalensis is grossly outdated. To start with, Neanderthals were light-skinned and probably red-haired. And more.

Among humans there is a need for Vit D that either comes from your diet or sunlight. Light skin is an adaptation for allowing limited sunlight to penetrate the epidermis to make production vitamin d possible. The DNA of Neanderthals have been sequenced. It would not hurt you at all intellectually to do some more reading: ""Red-Headed Neanderthals Ancient DNA has been used to show aspects of Neanderthal appearance. A fragment of the gene for the melanocortin 1 receptor (MRC1) was sequenced using DNA from two Neanderthal specimens from Spain and Italy: El Sidr√≥n 1252 and Monte Lessini (Lalueza-Fox et al. 2007). MC1R is a receptor gene that controls the production of melanin, the protein responsible for pigmentation of the hair and skin. Neanderthals had a mutation in this receptor gene which changed an amino acid, making the resulting protein less efficient and likely creating a phenotype of red hair and pale skin.

The narrator gets buried under the music and sound effects. <br />That&#39;s not to say that when the narrator is doing just that.. narrating.. that everything isn&#39;t just peachy, then there&#39;s an earthquake, the music comes up and the voice gets buried.<br />Understand this, I&#39;m not complaining about the volume level in general, but the mix of music/sound FX to narrator. <br />I believe the issues stems from a conversion from 5.1 surround sound to stereo. The rear channels gets sent to the front left/right, the center channel gets dropped, and the result is just about unwatchable. <br />This audio mix issue shatters my illusion of the technical prowess of the BBC.

The carbon dating, and DNA testing results are clear, definitive, and accepted throughout academia. Humans crossed from North-Eastern Siberia, into the new world somewhere between 27,000-30,000, whether on foot, or by the use of small water-craft. It is not a controversial idea, but I wonder how the BBC will approach ideas, findings, and narratives that really are in dispute. Will they present more than one theory, or consistently present certain perspectives over others, facts be damned, to support a larger much larger anti-western belief system, with the depiction pf actual history, left in the dust, if it doesn&#39;t support the ideologies now dominant in this once preeminent broadcaster?<br /> KOut	UCowurwb53iKY7aHjZH10KYw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCowurwb53iKY7aHjZH10KYw	0

Their using a lot of qualifiers like, "may, what if, and such" in the first minutes I've watched- which I appreciate. I've become accustomed to reading that the bottleneck in human DNA only exists out of Africa, and that only because a small group of one sapien tribe hiked into today's Yemen and started the entire non-African population, leaving a million years of sapien mutation and adaptation behind them in Africa. Even if the above is true, it only applies to sapien and has nothing to do with Neanderthal and Denisovan folks already in Europe and Asia thousands of year prior to sapien coming to those places.

The genetic anthro people believe the huge diversity of African DNA (vs the rest of the planet) is the long legacy of 200,000 - 400,000 years of homo sapien adapting solely in Africa and opposed to the vastly smaller (shorter) post Africa development, 50- 80,000 years, of "out of Africa" sapien adaptation. How did all that scattered Africann - sapien DNA survive to the present if Toba killed 99% of it? Your Neanderthal question begs the same answer. I'll have to look at the TOBA thing and see if there are answers. Doubt I'll be able to give it enough time to write back with much, but its the kind of research I've recently been excited about. Thanks for the tip. I'll start with Apocalypse.	UCL2C1XEjw8CqItBhine1y3A	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCL2C1XEjw8CqItBhine1y3A	1	Ugy0pXw01EtgJ0xzKEN4AaABAg	Brian Krarup

Still, if homo was wiped out, why not our cousins? This is the first I've heard of such a disaster anyway. Is Toba cause thIs history is pointing to for this near extinction of humans? This disaster theory doesn't make sense if nearly all of human diversity is in Africa. The African diversity was the result of 100 - 200k years of development. All that diversity is still there. Toba, or whatever disaster their referring to didn't kill all those ancient tribes and language groups either? I like the show, but the human obsession with creating a long complex narrative about ancient history, when only a few facts are available, really shows in this vid. They tell it like they were there, and there's no ambiguities or counter narratives to worry about.

Sure interbreeding has been found to have happened, as far as evidence suggest, between both species. But we cannot completely erase the possibility that some neanderthal and sapiens groups had a more violent encounter. To be honest, I think it was a little bit of both.

" nice try, but no we're not decedents from that one women" "maybe some powerful man, but noot that women" "Minute 41:26 this is why you don't want females to be in charge" "minute 18:00 they would lead you to believe it was a female who taught about using seeds, but the truth is it was probably a man as we're more mathematical and logical, so I doubt it was a female who notice seeds" Your comments are more based on your personal disdain towards females and less on facts or evidence. If you would like to continue this I may reply, but please provide a legitimate link to your "facts" instead of a google search, thanks.

These are proven scientific FACTS that most schoolchildren are required to know. Next ...Your deluded NARCISISSM has also allowed You to actually believe the Earth is flat. Worse yet You try to push Your bizarre beliefs on anyone within earshot. There are many live feeds here and on facebook/twitter. You can actually see the Earth REVOLVING! It might be a good lesson for You to witness how totally wrong You are and what pathetic laughingstock You've become in front of the entire ROUND Earth. I hope this is all a riduculous prank but I doubt it. You claim to work in German Robotics. Ok? Were You brought up in an isolated country where science is considered taboo? There is no other culpable reason for You to be so completely uninformed and uneducated. No person with your lack of general elementary knowledge is working in robotics. And if You ARE a representative of that field I think science needs to step back and start over again without You ... except to mop the floors and clean the toilets. Finally ... Instead of worrying about these all encompassing subjects You should focus on understanding Your unique mental health issues that seem to point towards Schizophrenia. Better yet ... Find Your way to the edge of the FLAT Earth and jump. What a perfect way to prove your point and satisfy everyone else in the meantime.

Second of all its a fact that "Minoans" were matriarchal through Archeological digs. 3rd as for the early days of man its facts mixed with speculation. This is not science, its mixed with speculation. What we can be sure of is how Males develop and females develop. We know mens strong suit in Intellectual as well as strength and how females are meant for baring children and been mothers and submissive.

History shows how the most established and trusted scientists of their day have been wrong over and over again mainly due to high opinions and not wanting to be shown as wrong , political and social agendas, money etc. at the end of the day there is no hard evidence of positive mutation of the type necessary to go from monkey to human and until that's proven the jury is out in my opinion	UCjGtBEMLmSG_gk8uPPxpJIA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjGtBEMLmSG_gk8uPPxpJIA	1	UgzK1WQIoO_jw9PEj3l4AaABAg	N Joyce

Do I really need to say more? How is that having an open mind? He also has many pages calling him a shill and has already been proven incorrect. Please tell me you have someone else who isn't a creationist with actual evidence and not some half-baked hypothesis/belief system?

Better yet, I'll just go ahead and quote you, "All DNA proves is we are similar to other species in some ways" (N Joyce, 2018).
