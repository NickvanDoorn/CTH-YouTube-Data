Ugz10BksW_cJdSBQgkJ4AaABAg	0	0	2018-12-31 04:03:22	Yang X	Thank you BBC so much for posting and proclaiming this documentary. This is truly wonderful. Through this, I have learned quite an abundance of powerful historic knowledge. Also, I am very happy to notice that there are a drastic difference between the negative comments in the last seven episodes and this one. This one obviously has less hate. But the other episodes have a lot more hate. I am not trying to criticize anyone but I just think personally that it is not righteous for one to hate someone else that is thoughtfully and kindly providing interesting and powerful knowledge. Please don&#39;t think my suggestion as problematic, rude, and criticized comment. Truthfully, it is not. It is only a gentle, kind, one. I really wonder why schools don&#39;t show these enthralling documentaries in history or socials studies classes. Again, THANK YOU BBC!!!

Russia and China enriched by accepting the model of the capitalist economy but these countries became neither democratic nor civilized with respect to human rights. Nowadays they undermine the base of our democracy, freedom of speech, respect to international laws and human rights. There is no end of history. They are back with a desire to impose totalitarian xenophobic rules to the rest of the world.	UCvRQi0fbaGVv3KSd3hiTOig	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvRQi0fbaGVv3KSd3hiTOig	0

Education is so wonderful and so important, and I wish that all people will take advantage of the unprecedented availability of material--I say it because the quantitative shift in this took place during my lifetime, so I&#39;m still in awe.<br /><br />...history can make us wise...<br />and journalism can make us aware of things happening in our own time... The terrible world wars happens, and their story is clear and dramatic. the gulf Wars, those in Iraq and Afghanistan are less clear about who is villain and who is hero, but we know, we have enough information to know to some extent who is responsible for what things.<br /><br />We start to look at Saudi Arabia critically, and question our close relationship now that mr. bone saw has revealed himself to be such an intolerant autocrat, but aren&#39;t we now supplying weapons and Logistics and fuel 4 the forces from, and paid for by Saudi Arabia inflicting war on largely civilian Yemen, where tens of thousands hundreds of thousands of civilians are right now dying from bombing campaigns and sick from cholera.<br /><br />it is not as clear and dramatic as an atomic bomb drop, but I am sure that each individual and his or her family suffer quiet enough pain and each one&#39;s death is no easier.<br /><br />Nor is the Washington Post&#39;s<br />journalist death and his family&#39;s suffering any less real or painful than those tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of yemenis&#39; deaths and suffering. <br /><br />The point of all of this is that we must be aware of the past and we must see the present clearly.<br /><br />The violence competition and brutality that we see throughout world history, underlined in this series, lives on in our own chromosomes and manifests itself in our lives and our country&#39;s foreign policies even at this very moment.

Such an invasion would have meant that we would probably have a North Japan and a South Japan nowadays. The choice that President Truman had was to sacrifice Japanese civilians who had either not paid attention to the Truman leaflets or were forced to stay in Hiroshima and Nagasaki on one hand and, on the other hand, try to invade Japan with the risk of causing enormous allied (and Japanese) losses. Both cities had military personnel (and, if I¬¥m not wrong, Hiroshima also had some allied P.O.W.s) and both cities were military objectives. The question still remains if what made the Japanese surrender to the U.S. were the bombs or fear of an invasion by the Red Army.
