Hell even the Church knew about it and was fine with it, only reason they started going on was later attacking science was thanks to the lose of common people not showing up to serve but instead going to Protestant churches so the Church dumbed itself down and started making text &quot;Heretic&quot; because they were becoming too &quot;Free thinking&quot;. Hell Copernicus(1533, it was explained to the Pope, Pope was pleased) (Before Galileo) reinforced the idea of the Earth rotated around the Sun, he even dedicated the book to the Pope and his theory was taught in Catholic Church &quot;Universities&quot; until Protestant Fundamentalist stated that certain passages in the Bible were being &quot;attacked&quot; from his theory, so the Church started a reign of suppression against the idea and the book itself.

But the Vikings discovered North America more than 300 to 400 years before anyone else.

She then told me that she has a hard time teaching it at all, knowing that there's concrete proof that it's not true, but has no choice because it's STILL part of the U.S. schools required curriculum! REQUIRED!! WTF!! You are totally right about about our so-called history being little more than a bunch of lies, and in my opinion, those "facts" that were taught are just more fairy tales...like the Bible is.

Funny that Vikings came to Canada first, had trading relationships with the natives and could live among them and beside them without killing them imprison them or make slaves out of them, and then put them in RESERVES that were nothing less than other prisons. It would be funny to see the Hawaiians, Russians, Chinese or Indonesians and see if they ever made it to the west coast of America too, way before the Europeans or the history of that was wiped away too. History books are all lies, like fake news today LOL Make it your reality and make sure to erase all others along the way to brainwash the rest of the people, might have a few murders, a few society wipe out but my reality will prevail LMAO . Proof doesn't come from books for me, but from what people have left behind and that we are still finding a lot today.

Also, Columbus' so-called "discovery" was for Spain, so exactly why is there a fraudulent holiday celebrated here? Why should we want to commemorate the "discovery" of this country by Spain? A "discovery" where foreign people came and attempted to kill off the native population? The whole thing is completely insane and ridiculous to me. It makes no sense, even if it had been a legit discovery, for us to want to designate a holiday for a Spanish discovery! It's all just bizarre to me. Also, as far as believing what we've been told/taught about history, I have a hard time believing anything that doesn't have actual concrete proof. History is and has always been told by the 'winners', which means that they can tell it however they want, so I'm definitely grateful for Archaeology, etc. so that we know facts instead of just stories told by the winners.

They were ruthless fighters, great tradesman, epic sailors, explorers, craftsmanship of all sorts. They had been to more places on earth than anyone else and discovered more civilizations than others, made alliances, trade deals etc but they didn't have writings like Europeans did. All that is to learn from this, never believe people who can make up history as they choose it to be to benefit from it.

I'm truly flabbergasted by the amount of people that advocate for failed tenants and/social policies that are literally destroying what's left of the west. Every decision that brought down the Roman Empire have been implemented into modern society. Slavery drove down the price of labor making the plebeians poor. Fiat currency destroyed the empire's wealth by devaluing it to the point that tradesmen and militia would not accept it. They even returned to bartering for a time. Universal suffrage dispensed with property rights which is one of the bedrocks of a free society. And the richer classes controlled the political agenda which caused anarchy. That is why the Byzantine Empire would last an additional thousand years after The Roman Empire was left in ruin. In 1911 President Woodrow Wilson decided to reverse the actions of President Thomas Jefferson who had held the currency to a gold standard. The Federal Reserve was born. And with it the ability of nations to borrow more money that they could ever repay. Only three years later we entered WWI. Then we received the income tax. What was promised as a temporary wartime measure would grow in cost and permanency. Today its hard to imagine not having an income tax which still remains unconstitutional. Around the same time the feminist movement was born. Quickly spreading through the North America and the United States in particular, women would be receiving the right to vote. They wielded this new found political power to enact the 18th amendment also known as prohibition. 1920's gangsterism is what followed and the birth of the mafia. The very immigrants that were brought to the United States during the industrial revolution would now seek opportunities within the ranks of their original countrymen and create tribalism within social and economic sectors. Power was consolidated and political power was purchased of forced by threat.  WWI paled in comparison to the expenditures of WWII and the income tax grew to an astronomical of 90%. This was eventually eased, but not before robbing many of their rights to wealth and property. Then there was the civil rights movement. A once prospering sub-culture in the United States would now be introduced to the welfare state and in a single generation, hundreds of years of values and work ethic would be lost. With particular emphasis on rewarding single parent households with social assistance, many black men (as they were still earning much less than whites) were literally kicked out of their households by the mothers of their children. Fatherlessness would now plague the black family and generations to follow would be part of the greatest incarceration of a demographic in modern history. From slaves to subculture to equals to prisoners in just over a century. With each war more expensive than the last, each law diluting our rights, each President kicking the can of debt and responsibility further down the road, each student lied to about our history, each new entitlement seen as a right is killing this republic and the murderers are all around us. They are those that prefer the government to do by force what we are meant to do by choice. So to answer your question, Trump very well could have made America great again. I just fear that he's decades too late..	UCDTxHMPFBu4cjcaSw3_3pew	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDTxHMPFBu4cjcaSw3_3pew	1	Ugy4D06kauItbMgbHTN4AaABAg	jennifer McDonald

They had no written language and had basically not yet entered the bronze age. Being conquered is the only way that civilizations have ever advanced in all of history. The Europeans had discovered a people tens of thousands of years behind in technology. To them these people were not equals. They were the equivalent of cave men that had no idea what the gold they were sitting on was worth. Up until 70 years ago this is how nations were formed. Its neither good or bad, its just the way things were.	UCDTxHMPFBu4cjcaSw3_3pew	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDTxHMPFBu4cjcaSw3_3pew	1	Ugy4D06kauItbMgbHTN4AaABAg	jennifer McDonald

Humans regardless of skin color have been ambushing and murdering each other since there was just one race in Africa and no humans anywhere else on the earth, that shit began with tribalism amongst hunter gatherers fighting for hunting territory and escalated to other resources that don't include base survival like gold. It also happened with other sapien species like Cro-Magnon and Neanderthal before the first humans arose in Africa. If ambushing and murdering a leader pisses you off... all humans including yourself should make you sick. When you look in a mirror you should despise yourself because you are human and capable of subterfuge during war just like the humans who were born and died in the last 100k+ years and the other sapiens who came and went before. Yes humans are shit regardless of the race, and they can be grand regardless of the race as well, only a racist cannot see that. Don't be a racist, you debase your own race when you are.

The Vikings had already been in North America and recent findings point to European hunter-gatherers of the Ice Age(Soleutrians) who had also been there.It´s a possibility that still needs to be studied just like the mystery of the Kennewick man that would still have to be solved, much to the dislike of Native Americans whose narrative might have to be reviewed if conclusive evidence is found that he is authentic (which might not be the case since, as I understand, research on the matter has been halted).

According to the “Saga of Erik the Red,” Eriksson crossed the Atlantic by accident after sailing off course on his return voyage from Norway after his conversion to Christianity. The “Saga of the Greenlanders,” however, recounts that Eriksson’s voyage to North America was no fluke. Instead, the Viking explorer had heard of a strange land to the west from Icelandic trader Bjarni Herjolfsson, who more than a decade earlier had overshot Greenland and sailed by the shores of North America without setting foot upon it. Eriksson bought the trader’s ship, raised a crew of 35 men and retraced the route in reverse. Therefore, as it was a saga or tail we can’t assert that actually happened.
