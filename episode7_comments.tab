UgxAXOGNDB4flTkDXEd4AaABAg	0	0	2018-11-30 04:46:58	david chapman	i enjoy these videos but they keep getting little things wrong. For instance, a couple of episodes back they described the interaction between Cyrus and Croesus. According to Herodotus, Apollo had nothing to do with the burning, it was because Croesus cried three times-Solon, Solon, Solon and Cyrus himself put out the flames to find out what the hell he was talking about! The rest of the story seems to be accurate.	UCoF8v7pWanDba-GW7ddXtTA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoF8v7pWanDba-GW7ddXtTA	0

They kidnapped the enemy tribes and sold them to the Europeans for slaves. If those african tribes had the advanced technology (compared to them) the Europeans had, that the tribes would have sat there and been peaceful and invented world peace, and nothing bad ever happens again?
