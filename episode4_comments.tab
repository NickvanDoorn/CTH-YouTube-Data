Pls stop these comment and keep your negativity to your self. Your negative attitude is not needed to be proclaimed here. I mean this suggestion in a polite and gentle way. If you do not like the documentary, which I love BTW, then you can click away. I think it would be a lot better to leave positive comments or a soft suggestion about some flaws. Thank you all! ( Attention- Pls no hate on my comment. Again, I mean this comment as a polite, friendly, and kind suggestion. Of course, you may or may not accept my suggestion, as it should be a free country. Again, THANK YOU. 😊😊😊	UCeq67Byh12uMF3YT4sa-XoQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCeq67Byh12uMF3YT4sa-XoQ	0

Its a disservice to the lessons learned from these events. In doing this they had to completely skip the cause of the dark ages altogether. And all this traveling forwards and backwards through time is confusing. There is no explanation as to why Rome fell and the Byzantine empire survived another thousand years. It reads remarkably close to my western civilization textbook back in college. It went on and on about witch burnings and the slave trade. Nothing about any great achievements of which there are many. <br /><br />We are taught not to revere the forefathers that left us this great society to inherit and that is to our own detriment. While we all reap the benefits of western wealth and culture, very few will actually learn the truth of those beginnings thanks to essential milestones being omitted by modern historians.

Yeah there's a point of pride in ancestry but since then Islamic countries have fallen behind and most of the world find Islamic laws and attitudes to be barbaric. And technologically speaking the best tech those countries have is imported. Maybe someday that can be reversed, but the continued reliance on oil across the globe and the instability in the region I cannot see that changing soon maybe another 2k years from now but I doubt there will be separate countries then.
