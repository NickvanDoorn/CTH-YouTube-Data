It really is very enthralling to learn about our ancestors and the history of the human race. I have recently scrolled down the comments and saw tons of complaints about the background music in these episodes. Nothing was a compliment except one person stating some possible reasons of the music being too loud, example for people turning their volumes up too intense. Personally, I can clearly hear the narrator speaking. I think that the dialogue in the documentary is still audible. Also, I think that people should give suggestions about the flaws in the documentary gently and mildly, instead of posting a big, over spoken comment about your complaints of the flaws. Just to let you know, that I am not trying to point out anyone&#39;s fault or trying to humiliate them. I am only giving you my personal opinion. You may or may not agree to my comment, it is a free country. Again, this is my thoughts, not yours so please, feel totally free to disagree. Anyway, I think that this documentary turned out really well. This gives viewers a visible picture of what things may have looked like in the past. Overall, AMAZING JOB BBC! WELL DONE! This really gave me an abundance of information of our history. Again, I am not attempting to blame or scold anyone who is complaining. Just providing a suggestion, comment, or idea. Hope you all enjoyed this video! (Attention : please no hate on my comment, thanks. Being hated on really hurts me as I have went through a lot of mental bullying and even though that has all been over, there are still side effects lingering that really affects me. So please, no hate, I would really hate to deal with any negativity as I am Christian and I like positive attitudes. Thank you all.

But when the audio is so loud and disruptive, it is considered to be, for copyright purposes dissimilar enough. So, yes, thanks for the best upload you can give. But, no, the music is purposefully disruptive so as to make it a different IP (intellectual property). This needs a strong change.

Likewise, India as a state and political entity was a very long way from existing as well. He was born in the Sakya Republic, a small state covering area that is now currently part of India and Nepal on the Indian subcontinent. History is impossible to grasp when thought of in terms of modern political borders - given that the oldest ones have only been around a few hundred years at the very most.

UgzmzrT8j40OkaHWIhl4AaABAg	2	20	2018-09-17 06:54:28	WeWereYoungandCrazy	There is a serious problem with the YouTube channel: BBC Documentary Published on Jul 19, 2018<br />ALL OF THE VIDEOS have a audio level mix issue. The narrator gets buried under the music and sound effects. <br />That&#39;s not to say that when the narrator is doing just that.. narrating.. that everything isn&#39;t just peachy, then there&#39;s an earthquake, the music comes up and the voice gets buried.<br />Understand this, I&#39;m not complaining about the volume level in general, but the mix of music/sound FX to narrator. <br />I believe the issues stems from a conversion from 5.1 surround sound to stereo. The rear channels gets sent to the front left/right, the center channel gets dropped, and the result is just about unwatchable. <br />This audio mix issue shatters my illusion of the technical prowess of the BBC. How did this get by your standards and practices?	UCTZBItyvSrDH3VnER0Gxa3Q	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTZBItyvSrDH3VnER0Gxa3Q	0
