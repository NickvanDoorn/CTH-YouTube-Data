It is actually a great documentary and I would love to share it with my friends and family - but I cannot bring myself to subject them to the infernal music!

Awful unrealistic reenactments, fake history, and terrible sound levels. I expect better from the BBC. This is trash.

The audio, narration, and order/lengths of the scenery have been pretty significantly amended by whoever posted it.

I find this not only inconsistent with the tonality of the narration, but a direct virtue signal to an anti-European perspective as well.

Slavery is bad for the economy as the Romans discovered. It drives down the price of labor and makes life as poor if not more so for the working class. It is synonymous with the undocumented migrants driving down wage prices in the modern day United States. To learn from history, it must be looked at through a dispassionate lens. Its the future we can control and that is why distorted documentaries like these are such a disservice.

If acknowledging that the "white" race continually practiced genocide and slavery of black skinned peoples on a global scale is "anti European" then deal with it. How many Europeans lived in their lavish homes with luxurious lifestyles while forcing the black man to toil in sweat and blood ??
